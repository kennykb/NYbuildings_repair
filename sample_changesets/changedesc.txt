    This is a typical changeset in an area where the original import
    was truncating street names ("East Main Street"->"Main").  It
    is simply putting the correct street name back onto 500 buildings
    among 42 streets.

addr:street=Old Portion Road: 4

    This changeset spells out the city name "St. James"->"Saint James"
    and corrects one misspelt street name.

    This changeset spells out "Saint James", moves a bunch of other
    buildings into the correct postal cities, and corrects about a dozen
    street names.

Changeset 44: 373 ways

addr:city=Smithtown: 367
addr:street=Express Drive North: 6

    Move 367 buildings to the ccorrect postal city, and add a missing
    "North" on the street address of 6.

addr:street=Mt Washington Road: 5
addr:street=East William Street: 1

    Add missing prefixes and suffixes. 'Mount' should of course
    be spelt out, but the source data didn't have it that way.
    Missing that wouldn't be a tragedy.

addr:street=Parkis Mills Road: 1

    The first actual error I found.  The street name 'Parks Mill Road'
    was a misspelling of a nearby 'Parkis Mills Road' - but both
    are incorrect for the building, which is on Old Mill Road.
    At least it's no worse.

    A mixed bag, but it mostly looks right.

addr:street=Carter Road Extension: 5
addr:street=Pre Emption Street: 2

    Nobody knows how "Preemption" should be spelt. "Pre-emption"
    might be correct, but the upstream data disallows punctuation
    in street names.
